This is a very basic prototype of overspeeding detection system which was made for a mini-project in college. The hardware components used are two IR sensor modules, 1 2 by 16 LCD display, an arduino UNO board, breadboard and jumper wires. The IR sensors are placed at a fixed distance, the time is calculated by the time difference between the two IR sensors detecting the vehicle, which is then used to calculate speed in cm/s as we used a toy car for this.Here we have set the threshold to 50cm/s.So whenever the speed exceeds the limit of 50cm/s, an alert message of "Overspeeding" is displayed on the LCD display.
